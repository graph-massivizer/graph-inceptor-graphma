# Scenario 3: Use GraphMa to implement two different custom operators.

In this scenario the beta-tester will implement two different custom operators extending the GraphMa library.

* Follow the instructions in the README on GitHub https://github.com/graph-massivizer/graph-inceptor-graphma/tree/main/doc/beta-testing-1/Scenario3.md
* Operator #1: Implement a traverser for a specific data structure/input file (e.g., CSV file).
* Operator #2: Implement a custom operator, wrapping a data structure/graph algorithm using JGraphT https://jgrapht.org/
* Compile the operators and add it to the GraphMa library.
* Test your newly written operators using existing test graphs from the GraphMa repository.
