# Scenario 4: Use GraphMa to implement a custom graph algorithm operator.

In this scenario the beta-tester will implement a custom operator extending the GraphMa library.

* Follow the instructions in the README on GitHub https://github.com/graph-massivizer/graph-inceptor-graphma/tree/main/doc/beta-testing-1/Scenario4.md
* Implement a custom operator, wrapping a data structure/graph algorithm using JGraphT https://jgrapht.org/
* Compile the operator and add it to the GraphMa library.
* Test your newly written operator using existing test graphs from the GraphMa repository.
