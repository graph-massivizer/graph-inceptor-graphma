# Scenario 1: Use GraphMa library (precompiled) and run a set of predefined graph  pipelines.

In this scenario you will use the GraphMa library (precompiled) through a command-line interface (CLI) to run a set of predefined graph pipelines.

* Follow the instructions in the README on GitHub https://github.com/graph-massivizer/graph-inceptor-graphma/tree/main/doc/beta-testing-1/Scenario1.md
* Run the graph pipelines by executing the CLI commands described in the README.
* Input datasets are given for each graph pipeline. The datasets are of different sizes. Run the same graph pipeline with the datasets of different sizes in order to provide some feedback on the performance.
