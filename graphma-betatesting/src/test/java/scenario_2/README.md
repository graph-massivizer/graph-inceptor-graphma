# Scenario 2: Use GraphMa to compose a graph pipeline from existing operators and run it.

In this scenario you will implement a custom graph processing pipeline using existing operators provided by the GraphMa library.

* Follow the instructions in the README on GitHub https://github.com/graph-massivizer/graph-inceptor-graphma/tree/main/doc/beta-testing-1/Scenario2.md
* The custom graph processing pipeline to be written is described in prose text.
* You will need to write a Java main function that chains together the operations into a pipeline. We will provide a code body that you can use as a starting point.
* Please consult the GraphMa documentation to find the correct operators to chain together for the Java main function.
* Compile and run the graph processing pipeline using the sample datasets provided.
* Run the graph processing pipeline using different dataset sizes to experiment with the performance.
