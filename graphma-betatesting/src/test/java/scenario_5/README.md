# Scenario 5: (OPTIONAL) Use GraphMa for Your Own Data Sources and Graph Processing Pipelines

This scenario is designed to let beta-testers apply the GraphMa library to their own unique use cases. After gaining familiarity with GraphMa's capabilities in previous scenarios, testers are encouraged to integrate the library with their own data sources and develop custom graph processing pipelines.

## Objective
Apply GraphMa to solve specific graph-related problems using personal or given data sources, utilizing the tools, operators, and techniques learned in previous scenarios.

## Steps to Implement

### 1. Identify a Use Case
Select a use case that is relevant to your work or interests where graph analysis could provide insights. This could be anything from social network analysis, infrastructure network planning, biological data interactions, or even traffic flow optimization.

### 2. Data Acquisition
Gather the data you need for your use case. This could involve:
- Using existing datasets from online repositories.
- Generating synthetic data.
- Extracting data from APIs or databases.
- Or simply use the provided data

### 3. Data Preparation
Prepare your data to fit into graph-based analysis:
- Format the data as needed (e.g., converting to CSV or JSON suitable for GraphMa).

### 4. Pipeline Design
Design a graph processing pipeline using GraphMa's operator framework:
- Use standard operators provided by GraphMa.
- Develop custom operators if necessary, to handle specific tasks unique to your data or analysis needs.

### 5. Analysis Execution
Run your graph processing pipeline:
- Perform analyses such as connectivity checks, centrality measurement, clustering, or pathfinding.
- Experiment with different configurations and parameters to optimize outcomes.

## Example Test
Here is a template you might use to start testing your custom pipeline:

```java
package your.package;

import graphma.data.sequence.operator.DataSource;
import graphma.data.sequence.pipeline.Pipeline;
import org.jgrapht.Graph;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class YourCustomTest {

    @Test
    public void testYourCustomPipeline() {
        // Setup your data source
        DataSource<Graph<String, DefaultEdge>> dataSource = ...;

        // Define your pipeline
        Pipeline pipeline = Pipeline.create(dataSource)
            .apply(...) // Apply various transformations and analyses
            .build();

        // Execute the pipeline
        pipeline.evaluate();

        // Output results
        System.out.println("Pipeline executed successfully with results: " + pipeline.getResults());
    }
}
