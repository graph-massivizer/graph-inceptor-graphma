# Scenario 3: Use GraphMa to Implement a Custom Graph Algorithm Operator

In this scenario, the beta-tester is tasked with implementing a custom operator to extend the GraphMa library. This involves wrapping a graph algorithm or data structure using the JGraphT library, which provides mathematical graph-theory objects and algorithms ([here](https://jgrapht.org/)).

## Overview

The goal is to create a custom operator that integrates seamlessly with existing GraphMa pipelines, leveraging the JGraphT library to perform complex graph computations. This scenario provides an opportunity to delve into the functional programming aspects of GraphMa and its operator-based architecture.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Magma operator design (see localMavenRepo).
- Basic knowledge of graph theory and JGraphT.
- Access to the GraphMa and Magma framework installed locally or in a development environment.

## Implementation Guide

1. **Create a New Operator:**
    - Navigate to the `BetaTest` class in the this package.
    - Define a new operator class that extends the GraphMa `Operator` base class.

2. **Integrate JGraphT:**
    - Utilize JGraphT to implement the desired graph algorithm within your operator. For instance, if calculating graph centrality measures, use the respective JGraphT class and methods.

3. **Operator Interface:**
    - Your operator should override necessary methods such as `open()`, `onNext()`, and `close()`. These methods handle the initialization, processing of graph data, and cleanup tasks, respectively.

4. **Testing:**
    - Write unit tests to verify the functionality of your operator. Ensure that it behaves correctly when integrated into a GraphMa pipeline.

## Example: Implementing a Graph Radius Calculation

In ExampleTest is an example implementation that calculates the radius of a graph, demonstrating how to structure your operator and integrate it into a GraphMa pipeline.
